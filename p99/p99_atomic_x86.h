/**
 ** @addtogroup atomic_x86 Atomic operations on i386 and x86_64
 **
 ** This implementation uses the @c xchgl instruction that is
 ** implemented since the early days of i386.
 **
 ** This instruction has an implicit lock prefix and no further OS
 ** support is needed to make it lock-free.
 **
 ** @remark This is only used if the gcc extensions for atomic lock
 ** free operations is not implemented directly by the compiler.
 **
 ** @remark Uses the @c __asm__ extension of gcc for inline assembler.
